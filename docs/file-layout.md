# File Layout

We've got a bunch of stuff that got made for us that I really don't know much
about. Let's document it and understand things better.

## eslint.config.js

## index.html

Why is this not in `public/` or `src/`?

## node_modules/

## package-lock.json

## package.json

## public/

What sort of things should go here?

## tsconfig.app.json

## tsconfig.json

## tsconfig.node.json

## vite.config.ts
